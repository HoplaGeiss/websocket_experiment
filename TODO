- check output from browser
- see the performance diff with Jon client

- experiment on ws to compare single threaded code vs SocketCluster

// ----------
// EXPERIMENT
// ----------

CLIENT

- See how many connections can create a single client
- Check if this number stays the same with more clients

SERVER

- fibonacci serie / fibonacci number 
  + CPU usage way to high
- long string
  + no noticable influence
    
- send file
- code single server with ws ?


- See what has the most influence: ping/sec, nb communication, size file
- Max concurrent connection


node_modules/socket.io-stream/lib/socket.js
REMOVE: 

if (stream.socket || stream.destroyed) {
      throw new Error('stream has already been sent.');
}
